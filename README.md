This is a simple web application that allows users to input the speed of a car and determines whether the speed is within the legal limit or if demerit points should be assigned.

## Features

- Users can input the speed of their car.
- The application calculates demerit points based on the speed:
  - If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it displays "Ok".
  - For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it assigns one demerit point and displays the total number of demerit points.
  - If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, it displays "License suspended".
- The user interface is colorful, interactive, and responsive.
